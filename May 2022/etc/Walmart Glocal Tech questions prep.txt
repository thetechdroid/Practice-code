Round 1 (machine coding round) :

Typically you are asked to write a working code for an online e-commerce application like Amazon , Flipkart etc
Apis :
- List of items based on location and availability
- Add item and create cart
- Filter Items based on Price , Ratings and Delivery Preference

You are required to construct the low level design and provide working code in 90 mins

Few Key Points -
- Use OOPs constructs extensible wherever needed
- Follow Proper Coding Standards
- Startup with DAO classes and Database Design and then come upto controller layer
- Good to have Junits (if time permits)

Round 2 (DS ALGO) :

- Given a root to a binary tree and two nodes , find out whether two nodes are cousins or not. (Nodes at same level but from different parent)

- Given an array of start time and end times of meetings , find the maximum no of meetings that can be arranged in a room (Condition for meetings - start time of next meeting > end time of current meeting)

Round 3 (DS/Algo , Design) :

- Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from DEL. 
Thus, the itinerary must begin with DEL.
-Detailed discussion on the current architecture of the project which I was working on.
Major highlighting parts were , Different Load Balancing paradigms you are aware of , what are the loopholes of the current architecture and if given a chance what alteration will you bring.

Round 4 (Managerial Round) :

- Mostly discussion on the current team I am part of
- Challenges I faced
- Tell me an incident where you had a fight/argument with someone senior in the team
- A Tech Question About Distributed Locking

Round 5 (HR) :
- Mostly situational based questions and few discussions on the current roles and responsibilities.



Possible first round questions:


Non repeating longest substring
Valid Sudoku
Coin change problem pseudo code L
Insertion sort variation hacker rank test
Easy question on lists 
Coding round - mainly questions around string manipulation
Implement LRU cache and cache based questions in general
Activity selection problem for trains
How does hash map work internally. how will you implement your own hash map. L
How many pairs present in a list having given sum. L

given a list of numbers, find if any number in the list is prefix of another number
Find kth largest element in a stream of numbers
Recursive method to reverse a string
Given a root to a binary tree and two nodes , find out whether two nodes are cousins or not. (Nodes at same level but from different parent)
Given an array of start time and end times of meetings , find the maximum no of meetings that can be arranged in a room (Condition for meetings - start time of next meeting > end time of current meeting)


Done :

Find if Linked List has loop, if so, find length of the loop. == done


1st round karat interview guide:

================= I wrote this = start =================

1 hour with 1 engineer from Karat
45 mins for DS Algo questions
10 mins open ended questions (Behavioural + project based questions) = You will have an option to choose from 5 6 categories
Recruiter said it could be 3 questions, but when I was registering for karat interview, I was told 1 question only for 45 mins (could be OOP or OOD based)
They are looking for a simple code which is functional and then go for optimization
If it doesn't go well in your opinion, you can reschedule in 24 hours
Could be a mix of feature imp (design something like a Twitter) or plain DS/Algo

================= I wrote this = end=================


Karat interview questions:

1. Short introduction
2. Asked me to select few topic on which the interviewer asked me questions based on CS fundamentals. Topics includes but not limited to, OOD, OS, Software Testing etc.
3. Asked me LC medium question. Mentioned that he is looking for complete executable solution instead of optimal one. 
I was able to code it quickly so asked another medium question. Explained my approach but not able to code it completely as only 10 minutes were left.
4. Lastly, asked me if I have any questions for him.

Questions asked (from Blind):

 find if word exists in the array and variation of word search
 An easy LC and a medium LC
 1. Given a two dimensional matrix of binary numbers find the number of continuous rectangles that are entirely based on zeros.
2. How to define classes to represent rubik's cube and implement some basic functionality like twist and is complete?
 
 They always ask LC : 1 simple,  1 medium and 1 hard
